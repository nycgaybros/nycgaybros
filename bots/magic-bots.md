# Magic Bots

## Magic Bot - Embed Generator link

~~~~[**Embeds**](https://discord.club/embedg/) **help in making the discord text more structured and let you add a lot of info in one message.**

{% hint style="info" %}
 the embed functionality requires a webhook \(more on webhooks [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)\)

You can either generate a new webhook or use the existing one on the server settings -&gt; Webhooks section
{% endhint %}

The documentation on the embed bot is [here ](https://docs.discord.club/embedg/reference/field-reference).. Please note the mentions section as it can be confusing.

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
