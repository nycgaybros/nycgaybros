# Rules

 **No Discrimination and No Intimidation - Any User found violating this rule should be banned.**

_Any posts /chats that suggest any form of Racial, Sexual or Gender or Social bias will be removed \(this includes cases of BWC, BBC, No Whites, No Asians etc._

 **NSFW stays in NSFW Channels. Offenders will be muted.** _\(apply_ KARMA ROLES \(mute\) to mute the user\)

 **No Spamming or Self Promotions without approvals from Mods -** anyone wanting to organize or market events should speak to the mods first

## Moderator Rules

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Primary Role of a server mod  is to engage** the members...  We should be active, support, motivate and correct when needed. 
{% endhint %}

**Ban/Kick/Mute** moderation should only be used in genuine cases of violations. Each instance reported immediatedly on MODCHAT. **when in doubt dont ban/dont kick**, always check, If admins are not available, **simply mute the user until a decision can be reached.**

ideally all Ban decisions must be vetted by at least another mod/helper/admin. Each ban should be followed by a clear explanation of why the ban was given and if its temporary, how long it will last.

> _**if a**_ _**mod violates any of the 3 core rules or the above mod specific guideline, the mod role will be removed post review of circumstances.**_

Mods **should not engage in severe public argument on the server,** if the user is being irate, create a channel, invite the user so it doesn't affect the operations/morale of the server

**if a mod is not active on the server for a prolonged period of time,**  the person should highlight schedule limitations on mod chat for transparency. Admins can either recruit helpers to pitch in or step in to provide additional coverage.

 if **for any reason, a moderator doesn't want to operate in the role**. The person can give up/abandon the **role with a 1 week notice**. if separation was on on good/respectable terms, the role **"friends of Bros"** can be assigned as respect for the contribution.

## Admin Rules

Admins are bound by all of the above rules. In addition, they are also required to act as arbitrators when there is conflict between members/mods and mods/mods. 

Admin Roles carry an overriding responsibility on the server. they can reverse / challenge a decision by a mod made in the absence of Admin quorum / without the knowledge of /contradictory to the server ethos.. Ultimately, Admins Resolutions are the final course of remedy in a dispute. 

**if Admins cannot continue in their roles for any reason,** they can abandon their role **with a 1 week notice.** They can be given the "friends of Bros" novelty role to recognize their past contribution
