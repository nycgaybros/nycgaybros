## Getting Super Powers

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nycgaybros/nycgaybros/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

{% code title="hello.sh" %}

echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
