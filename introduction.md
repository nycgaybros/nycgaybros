# New Members

## What happens when someone new joins....

### **when a user joins the channel, the person is given an unverified role. this enables access to introduction, rules, roles and announcements.**

> The User with **Unverified** will be given a Captcha verification by YAGPD \(bot\) and once successfully verified, user gets **Verified** role.  
>
> The verified role only confirms **that you are not a bot**, so once confirmed you are allowed to post links and pictures. **However, the full role is still MEMBER \(BRO\)**

 _PS: currently the toggle to remove **unverified** isn't working, so needs to be removed mechanically ``_

### **Member Role** is granted to the user using INTEGROMAT \(integromat.com\) workflow tool.

it parses the users introduction and identifies the quality of the post. Salutations, length of text etc. If conditions are met, the member role is granted. the current delay is 60 mins.

### NSFW Sections are on opt in.  

* NO NSFW / NSFW Roles sit above Member/Verified roles. They allow for a user based opt in post confirming if they are above 18 or not.
