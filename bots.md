## Managing Dyno

Dyno is the primary administration bot on the server. The link to the dashboard  is here. [**control panel**](https://dyno.gg/manage/645399322682327040)\*\*\*\*

**a list of all commands** is below, we only use a few, however functionality exists if we were to expand. DYNO [**Commands** ](https://dyno.gg/commands)is an exhaustive list

**a list of** [**custom commands**](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands) ****is available - although, these are only every used for fun \(mostly not activated\) refer to custom commands section on dyno management.

{% hint style="info" %}
Dyno commands follow a prefix - currently set to "?" if you want to write help, you would type "?Help" and hit enter.
{% endhint %}

if something is not working as designed, either its configured incorrectly or there are permission issues. Checkout the [FAQ section ](https://dyno.gg/faq)to understand the common issues /mistakes we make
